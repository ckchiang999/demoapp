# demoapp

This is a built from the typescript starter template from React Native.  I tried to build out a drawer navigation menu, a login page, and some screens to test the navigation.  I wrote an authentication provider context following a tutorial from React Navigation.  I also wrote a couple of Jest tests to demonstrate how tests can be written.  So this is a good starting point for a project that needs navigation, login, some working screens connected by navigation, and some rudimentary tests.
